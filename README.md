= Getting started =

In order to contribute to uOFW, you need advanced MIPS ASM skills and C skills. Some good MIPS ASM  
online resources can be found at: 
http://www.mips.com/products/product-materials/processor/mips-architecture/  
MIPS ASM Instruction Set Reference: http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/devel/assembly/mips-iv.pdf  

In addition, there is a nice MIPS runtime simulator and debugger which can be found at:

The next step is to improve your reverse engineering skills (if needed). We suggest reading the  
following excellent guide about reverse engineering for the PSP:
