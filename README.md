uOFW
====

The unofficial Official FirmWare, a complete latest PSP firmware reverse engineering project.  

Project page: http://uofw.psnpt.com/  
Doxygen documentation: http://uofw.github.com/uofw/ 
For more information: http://dev.psnpt.com/redmine/projects/uofw/wiki  

NOTE: We currently plan to move the wiki and shutdown the project page instead. We'll keep you 
      updated on this as progress is being made.  
      NEW: The documentation has now been moved to Github!


## Getting started

In order to contribute to uOFW, you need advanced knowledge in MIPS ASM and C. Some good MIPS ASM  
online resources can be found [on the MIPS company page](http://www.mips.com/products/product-materials/processor/mips-architecture/).  
MIPS ASM Instruction Set Reference: http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/devel/assembly/mips-iv.pdf  

In addition, there is a nice MIPS runtime simulator and debugger which can be found at:  
http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/

The next step is to improve your reverse engineering skills (if needed). We suggest reading [this  excellent guide]
(http://psnpt.com/joomla/index.php/articles/39-tutorials) about reverse engineering for the PSP. 

We are reverse engineering the PSP kernel version 6.60, please make sure you are working on modules of 
this firmware version.

If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask us!


## Installation & Running

For information on how to install and run uOFW, please look [here](https://github.com/uofw/uofwinst).


## Repository structure

uOFW's Github repository contains one 'master' branch and several sub-branches. 

The master branch is aimed to contain only tested and working code (in fact, it should contain working modules). 
Please note that this is not entirely the case right now as we still need to test, and fix, some of the code in the 
master branch due to the past repository structure.

Then there are sub-branches which are aimed to each represent a module currently being worked on. Such a branch
contains unfinished, untested and undocumented code about the module it is named after. Once such a branch contains
finished, documented code (that is, the module has been finished reverse-engineering) it will be merged into
the 'master' branch.
Currently, there are five sub-branches: [clockgen] (https://github.com/uofw/uofw/tree/clockgen), 
[libaac](https://github.com/uofw/uofw/tree/libaac), [memlmd](https://github.com/uofw/uofw/tree/memlmd), 
[power](https://github.com/uofw/uofw/tree/power), [psheet](https://github.com/uofw/uofw/tree/psheet)


## Additional Information

While you reverse-engineer parts of the PSP's kernel, you may will find yourself in a position
where you would like to know more about how Operating Systems work in general. We suggest to check
out [this webpage](http://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page).
